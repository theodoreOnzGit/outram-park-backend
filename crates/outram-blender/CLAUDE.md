Guidance for Claude Code (and other AI assistants) working in the `outram-blender` crate.

## Reactor geometry is DRAWN for a human to check before it is trusted (HARD RULE)

**Maintainer direction, 2026-09-25.** Binds this crate. The same rule is in the
`CLAUDE.md` of `outram-mc-libs`, `nee_soon`, every `outram-foam-*` crate and
every crate downstream of them; a crate that newly depends on one of those
takes the rule into its own `CLAUDE.md` (check with `cargo metadata`).

**Whenever you build or change a complex reactor geometry** — CSG cells and
surfaces, lattices, pebble beds, TRISO particles, reflector zones, control-rod
bands, a CFD/FEM mesh, anything a solver will transport or integrate through —
**draw it, as images a human can open (PNG, or JPG/SVG), and hand them over**
before any result computed on it is reported as more than tentative.

- **Draw what the solver sees, not what you meant.** Render from the ASSEMBLED
  geometry (cell / material lookup at each pixel, or the mesh itself), never
  from the named constants. A picture of the constants hides exactly the
  defects this rule exists to catch.
- **Minimum set:** an axial slice (R-Z / x-z) of the whole model; radial (x-y)
  slices at the heights that matter; and, for nested geometry, zoomed slices at
  every level down to the smallest (pebble, TRISO particle). Colour by
  material, with a legend and the key dimensions marked.
- **Commit the images with the change** (beside the V&V record or the
  manuscript package) and point the human at them by path in your summary.
  Regenerate them whenever the geometry changes.
- **Say what you checked in them, and what you could not** — an image nobody
  was told to look at checks nothing.

**Why.** On 2026-09-24/25 the HTR-10 model carried, at once: a bottom reflector
mirrored from the top and up to 107 cm short; a core cavity that grew with the
bed; pebbles interpenetrating by 1.1 cm with 4.8 % of core carbon clipped away
(gh:#309, #310); and a TRISO lattice holding 8240 particles while reporting
8340 (gh:#316, +353 pcm). Every run completed with green diagnostics. Each was
found by looking at the built geometry, not by the eigenvalue.

**Tools.** ~~`outram_mc_libs::geometry::plot` samples a slice of an assembled
CSG geometry; OpenMC-parity image output (PNG/JPG) is the preferred path once
it lands.~~ **UPDATED 2026-09-25 — it has landed (gh:#268):**
`outram_mc_libs::geometry::plot` is a port of OpenMC's plotter that writes PNG
directly — slices, wireframe and solid ray traces — verified pixel-for-pixel
against `openmc --plot`
(`crates/outram-mc-libs/verification_and_validation/geometry_plotting/`).
`render_material_slice` draws a material-coloured slice with a legend and cm
axes in one call; `crates/nee_soon/examples/htr10_geometry_images.rs` is the
worked example. For meshes, plot the mesh itself (cells, patches, zones).
